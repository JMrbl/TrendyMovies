# TrendyMovies  +In Development+
Final Project from Udacity's Android Development Course (Android Fundamentals)

From this stage, if you want to test what I have so far, you need to get a The Movie DB ApiKey from this site https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup

Once you have an APIKEY, you need to add the following line in your gradle.properties (Project Properties) file:

  MovieDBApiKey = "[Your API key]"  

Otherwise, the application will not work
